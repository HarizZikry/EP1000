# Web Development
We need to create our own webpage to document our progress in the module and for assignment. I learned how to html through videos from [Jake Wright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com). I am usng notepad++ as a web editor. We were also told to create a [github](https://www.github.com) account so that we can publish our website.
