# Web Development

We need to create our own webpage to document our progress in the module and for assignment. We are required to install a text editor and learn html.

## Text Editors

This is what we are going to use to add and edit stuff in our webpage. Our lecterer gave us  recommendations for text editor. I chose to use Atom as it an open-source github project and we are going to use github to publish our webpage. I find it simple to use and easy to learn.

## HTML

Hpertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in web browser. All website are developed with HTML. I learned how to html through videos from [Jake Wright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com). I find it easier to familarise with HTML as I took Computer Programming in year 1, you tell the program what to do.

## Github

Github is used to publish our webpage. First, we had to create a [github](https://www.github.com) account to access it. Then, we create a repository. How repository works is basically we upload our webpage with any relevent files to the repository and it transforms into a webpage. It is used to host our webpage.
