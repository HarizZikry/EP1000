# Fablab Safety

We went through powerpoint slides on fablab safety. Safety is taken seriously in the lab. We went through rules and regulation, some case studies, how to avoid dangerous senarios and what to do if things go south.

## Rules and regulation

Some important rules to take note of:
- Do not tamper with safety devices and machine guard
- Be alert
- Know the location of emergency stop button
- When operating machine tools, ensure others are not exposed to danger

## What to do in case of accident or fire

1. Don't panic
2. inform lecturer or TSO
- If there is no lecterer or TSO around, follow **3-step Emergency Procedure**
  1. call 995
  2. Instruct them to enter **Gate 1** (Main Entrance) along Dover Road.
    - Provide location of incident
  3. Inform Campus Security by calling **6772-1234** (all emergencies and incident reporting)

## Safety Assessment

This is a compulsory assessment for all users of Fablab@SP. We need to pass the assessment in order to enter the lab and operate the machines.

Due to Circuit Breaker, safety assessment will be postponed until labs are open for use.
