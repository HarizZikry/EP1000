# Fablab Safety
During the lecture session, my lecturers brief us on fablab safety. They told how to behave in the lab safety measures to take and aslo what would happen if we do not take safety seriously in the lab. Due to circuit breaker, therei no lab sessions at the moment hence we did not take the Fablab safety assessment.
