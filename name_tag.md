I begin by drawing a rectangle with dimensions 50mm by 20mm on the origin. I added an eclipse on 1 side of the rectangle, 20mm by 13.32mm. After drawing the main shape, I offset it by 2mm. Next I got started on the key ring hole. I draw a small circle with radius 3.75mm, then constraint it to align with the center of the rectangle and dimension it 6.66mm from the side of the rectangle. After that, I created another small circle. First step of extrusion is to extrude the outline by 4mm. Next step is to extrude the inner area by 1mm. To finish it off, I create a new sketch on the inner area to put my name on it and extrude it by 3mm.
