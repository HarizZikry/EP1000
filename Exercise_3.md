I break this object into 3 parts to make it easier.

## Part 1

I draw the rectangle-semicircle combo on the origin. Rectangle has dimensions of 40mm by 20mm and semicircle  has diameter equal to length of rectangle. I added the 10mm radius circle at the center of the circle and proceed to extrude.

## Part 2

I create new sketch at the front face of the rectangle. Draw the rectangle with the preferred dimensions and then extrude by 10mm away from the main shape

## Part 3

New sketch on the top face of new rectangle and draw rectangle with its dimensions. Extrude and add fillets.
