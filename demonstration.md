# Demonstration

- I Create a new repository as an example.

- Using Atom, I add a paragraph in "readme.md" and save the file.

- The change will appear in git. Git will ask you to commit the change with a description. I commit the change to update the file.

- I then replace the paragraph with a second one, save the file.

- Similar to the previous step, I commit the change

- When I am satisfied with the paragraph, I publish the file to github.

- Here is a screenshot of the repository. It shows the second paragraph.

- I decided to go with the first paragraph, so in git I browse the history and search for the commit with the first paragraph.

![](/images/RepositoryExample/extract.png)

- I right clicked on the commit and select "revert to this commit". This means that I will get back the first paragraph.

- I publish the new file to github. Now you can see the last paragraph in the repository.
