## How I created the Design
1. Draw the ABEC 608 Bearing dimensions 8 x 22 x 7 mm on the origin. Draw another circle larger than the outer diameter of the bearing to house it.
2. Sketch the shape of the fidget Spinner. It must be able to house the M8 hex nuts and maximum radius of the fidget spinner is 50mm. I went with the most common fidget spinner shape. I used circles as it is able house the M8 nuts well and lines to connect it to the center.
3. Add the M8 nuts to the fidget spinner. Draw a polygon with the same dimensions as the M8 nuts.
4. Extrude. I Extrude it by 4 mm in both ways. Don't extrude the bearing and the M8 nuts.
5. Chamfer the edges to remove sharp edges
