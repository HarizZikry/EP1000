## How it's done

1. Create a new sketch on the XZ plane. Draw a construction rectangle dimensions  50 x 25 mm, acts as a guideline.
2. Use the fit point spline to create the shape of the bowl. Only draw half the bowl as I will use revolve. Ensure that the bowl has a base big enough so that it can stand.
3. Offset the line to give the bowl thickness, at least 1 mm. Connect the lines to form a shape.
4. Using revolve, select the profile and the axis (Z axis). Check the shape of the bowl.
5. Fillet the sharp edges
