# Background change

The goal is to remove the existing background then replace it.

<img src="/EP1000/images/profilepic.jpg" style="width:500px;height:500px;"><br>

1. Open the image in gimp, then scale to 500 by 500 px.
2. Select layer > transparency > add alpha channel.
3. Use the free select tool and draw the outline of the area that I want to keep.
4. Once selection is done, got to select > invert. This means that the unwanted area is now selected.
5. Go to edit > clear. What's left in the canvas is the wanted area.
6. Open the new background image as a layer and scale it down 500 by 500 px.
