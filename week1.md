# Week 1

I came up with a few design and mechanism to be used. I decided to make it simple and cost effective.
So here is the sketch,

I decided to go with the Slide Door system instead of Auger system because it is less complexed and it is quite troublesome to 3D print an auger. I felt that the auger would be less efficient than the hatch door. The main case and "hatch door" will be laser cut while the hopper system and bracket will be 3D printed. TetraBytes will be programmed to feed the fish once a day, this will be displayed by the LCD. For the hatch door, a positional servo motor will be used to open and close the door.

*Main components I need:*
- Arduino Uno
- Small Breadboard
- Servo FS90 9g
- LCD 1602 2x20 with I2C
- DC 9V power adapter/9V battery
