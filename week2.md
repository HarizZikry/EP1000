# Week 2

I designed the case using fusion360. I want it to be compact and light. It needs to hold the fish food and electronics, therefore the case needs a divider.

The case dimension is 160mm x 80mm x 100mm. I had to create an opening on the divider for the wire of servo motor.

Next, I create the hopper. I will need to use loft to make the overall shape, then create a shell with thickness of 1mm. I will make an opening on the hopper. The hopper was quite easy to make.

I decided to put a hinge on the fish food cover to make it more accessible.

Next, I need to make openings for the LCD display and servo motor. I took down the dimensions of the components then design. The opening for servo was abit difficult to create but I think I got it right.
