# Week 2

I designed the case using fusion360. I want it to be compact and light. It needs to hold the fish food and electronics, therefore the case needs a divider.

The case dimension is 160mm x 80mm x 100mm. I had to create an opening on the divider for the wire of servo motor.

Next, I create the hopper. I will need to use loft to make the overall shape, then create a shell with thickness of 1mm. I will make an opening on the hopper. The hopper was quite easy to make.

I decided to put a hinge on the fish food cover to make it more accessible.

Next, I need to make openings for the LCD display and servo motor. I took down the dimensions of the components then design. The opening for servo was abit difficult to create but I think I got it right.

I export the case and hatch door as dxf and compiled them into 1 dxf file using Inkscape. I also save the hopper as stl file and slice it for 3D printing using Cura

I realised that the hopper was too complex and long for 3D printing so I rescale/redesign the hopper to reduce time. I also had to make changes to the case as now the hopper will occupy a smaller area.

Here is the  final hopper and case:

Next I need to create a mount for the case to sit on the fish tank. I made a clamp-like mount using screws to tighten. I got it ready for 3D printing. However, it did not turn out great. The threads I created are gone because of the supports. I realised that the screw and threads were too small so the 3D printer was not able to accurately print it, this means that I need rescale the mount and screw threads.
